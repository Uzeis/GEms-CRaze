# GEms-CRaze
Game Concept:
Gem Craze is a fast-paced puzzle game where the player must match gems of the same color to score points. The game board is filled with various colored gems that are constantly moving. The player's goal is to match gems in groups of three or more to make them disappear and score points. The game becomes more challenging as the player progresses through each level.

Game Rules:

The player starts with a game board filled with gems.
The gems are constantly moving in various directions.
The player must match three or more gems of the same color by clicking on them.
Once the gems are matched, they disappear, and new gems fall from the top of the game board to fill the empty spaces.
The player earns points for each set of matched gems.
The game ends when there are no more moves left, or the player reaches the target score for that level.
The player can use power-ups like bombs and hammers to help them clear the board.
The player can also earn extra points by creating combos or matching special gems.
User-Interactivity:

The game is designed to be played with a mouse or touch screen.
The player can click on the gems to select them.
The game board reacts to the player's movements and displays visual feedback when gems are matched.
The player can use power-ups by clicking on them.
The game has a leaderboard that displays the top scores of other players.
Playful:

The game features colorful and animated gems that are fun to watch.
The game has sound effects that enhance the gameplay experience.
The game has a reward system that encourages the player to keep playing.
Addictive:

The game is designed to be challenging and engaging.
The player is constantly trying to beat their high score and move up the leaderboard.
The game has multiple levels that become progressively more difficult.
Implementation:

To implement Gem Craze in ReactJS, we can use the React hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext.
We can create components for the game board, gems, power-ups, and leaderboard.
We can use CSS animations to create the movement of the gems.
We can use React's virtual DOM to update the game board when gems are matched.
We can use local storage to store the player's high score and leaderboard data.
I hope you enjoy playing Gem Craze!
